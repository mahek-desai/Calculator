Calculator In Logisim Using Concepts of Digital Electronics
Logisim Calculator â€“ Digital Electronics Project
This project is a 4-bit Calculator designed using Logisim, a digital logic simulator. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations using logic gates, multiplexers, adders, and other combinational circuits. It serves as an educational tool for understanding digital circuit design and Boolean logic.

Key Features
Arithmetic Operations: Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Magnitude Comparator and Division.
4-bit Input Support: Operates on 4-bit binary numbers.
Binary Display: Results are shown in binary format using LEDs or a seven-segment display.
Logic Circuit Implementation: Designed using fundamental digital logic components such as:
AND, OR, NOT, XOR gates
Multiplexers
Decoders
Full Adders and Subtractors
User-Friendly Interface: Inputs are provided by the user and the output is systemetically displayed.
Technologies Used
Logisim: Open-source logic circuit simulator for designing and testing the digital calculator.
Digital Logic Design: Implemented using fundamental combinational and sequential circuits.
How to Use
Open the Logisim project file (.circ) in the Logisim simulator.
Use the switches to input binary numbers.
Select the desired operation using a multiplexer or control buttons.
View the calculated result in the output display.
Applications
Learning Digital Electronics and Boolean Logic.
Understanding the working of ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) in processors.
Academic projects for computer engineering and electronics students.
This project demonstrates the core principles of digital computation and helps students gain hands-on experience with logic circuit design.
